# 56G - Airport Re-imagining

Some of the airports in the game are no longer in service, so they are basically just a farm field.  

This is a complete re-imagining of the 56G airport, and in no way represents the real world version.
The runway headings were maintained, and the runway lengths were kept as close to the original as possible.
